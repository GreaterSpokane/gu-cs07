const median_household_income_blurb = "A household income is the total amount of money those living in a home earn in a year. The median household income is the income amount that divides the population into two groups: half of the homes having an income above this amount, and half of those homes having an income less than that amount. The median household income is heavily influenced by the national economy, however, there are many local factors that can influence a region's median household income."

const natural_change_blurb = "Natural change is the measurement of the number of births and deaths in a population. A greater natural increase (births - deaths > 0) means the population is growing naturally, otherwise, the population is decreasing naturally."
