        h2 Description 
        p.description-text
        | Our group is looking to develop a web based tool that utilizes a series of economic indicators to provide a 
        | snapshot of the local economy and Spokane is performing on overall economic performance, resiliency, equity 
        | and inclusivity. We have a seperate project to identify these indicators and where these 
        | indicators can be found. Our project is to take this data and present it in a way that is easily digestible. 
        | The project will also seek to automate the data entry as much as possible, identifying the cycle that data 
        | may be updated from sources and posted on-line and then incorporated into the dashboard.
